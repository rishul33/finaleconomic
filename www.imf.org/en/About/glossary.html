            <td>An explanation for global imbalances first proposed by Dooley,    Folkerts-Landau and Garber. It refers to the unilateral actions by emerging    markets, especially in east Asia, to manage their exchange rates with    reference to the US dollar. In particular, the authors noted that differing    economic priorities (export-led growth in EMEs and financial liberalization    in advanced countries) ensured that the present international monetary system    would be a mixed system of fully floating and managed exchange rates. The    authors further contend that the system is robust, though others disagree.    Cooper has also noted that the deeper and more sophisticated financial system    in advanced countries (in particular, the US) and its more favourable    demographics naturally favour such a mixed system. The name &ldquo;Bretton Woods    II&rdquo; aims to signal parallels between the unilateral actions of some countries    at the present time and the earlier (multilateral) compact that characterised    the original Bretton Woods system.</td>

As such, these countries are forced to borrow    in foreign currencies, which, in turn exposes them to currency risk and    potentially balance of payments crises. An explanation for the unprecedented    accumulation of reserves by emerging markets in recent years is founded on    the idea of self-insurance for precautionary purposes when original sin may    be an issue.</td>

            <td>Surveillance in its present form was established by Article IV    of the IMF&rsquo;s Articles of Agreement, as revised in the late 1970s following    the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. Under    Article IV, member countries undertake to collaborate with the IMF and with    one another to promote exchange rate stability. For its part, the IMF is    charged with (i) overseeing the international monetary system to ensure its    effective operation, and (ii) monitoring each member's compliance with its    policy obligations under Article IV, Section 1. In June 2007, the legal    framework for surveillance underwent a major update with the adoption of the    Decision on Bilateral Surveillance over Members&rsquo; Policies. The Decision    clarifies that country surveillance should be focused on assessing whether    countries&rsquo; policies promote domestic and external stability. This means    surveillance should mainly focus on monetary, fiscal, financial, and exchange    rate policies and assess risks and vulnerabilities. It also provides guidance    to members on how to conduct exchange rate policies in a way that is    consistent with the objective of promoting exchange rate stability and    avoiding manipulation.</td>

The Third Amendment (November 1992)    allowed for the suspension of the voting and certain related rights of a    member that fails to fulfill any of its obligations under the Articles (other    than obligations with respect to SDRs). The Board of Governors in September    1997 adopted a resolution to amend the Articles to allow for a special    one-time allocation of SDRs. The Fourth Amendment will become effective when    three-fifths of membership having 85 percent of the total voting power have    accepted it.</td>

            <td>In his original proposal for a post-war international monetary    system, British economist John Maynard Keynes envisaged a global bank (the    International Clearing Union or ICU), which would issue its own currency    (bancor), based on the value of 30 representative commodities including gold,    exchangeable against national currencies at fixed rates. All trade accounts    would be measured in bancor, while each country would maintain a bancor    account vis-&agrave;-vis the ICU (expected to be balanced within a small margin),    and also have an overdraft allowance vis-&agrave;-vis the ICU. When countries    experienced large trade deficits (more than half of the bancor overdraft    allowance), they would pay interest on their accounts, undergo economic    adjustments (possibly also capital controls) and devalue their currencies.    Conversely, countries with large trade surpluses would also be subject to a    similar charge and required to appreciate their exchange rates. Keynes    expected that this mechanism would bring in a smooth symmetry of adjustments    across countries and avoid global imbalances.</td>

            <td>Refers to the international monetary system in operation in    the post-war period until the end of the gold exchange standard in 1971. The    name comes from the agreements put in place at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,    where delegations from 44 countries gathered to construct a post-war global    monetary and financial architecture, including creating the IMF and the World    Bank. The system was characterized by a system of adjustable pegs to the US    dollar, which in turn, was pegged to gold at $35 an ounce. Countries could    adjust their currency values in consultation with the IMF and their partners.    While the system largely prohibited restrictions on current account    transactions, capital controls were explicitly allowed, and indeed seen as a    means of ensuring the system&rsquo;s stability. By the late 1960s, a fundamental    tension arose whereby the domestic macroeconomic policy imperatives in the    United States were at odds with the need to maintain the stability and smooth    functioning of the international monetary system. This spurred an effort to    find a new reserve asset that could act as a substitute for the dollar or any    other national currency, thereby addressing this flaw, which led to the    creation of the SDR. The system came to an end when the United States dropped    the link between the dollar and gold due to a need to regain monetary    independence and the fiscal expenditures related to, among others, the war in    Vietnam.</td>

While the IMF    Articles of Agreement do not, with very limited exceptions, impinge on    members&rsquo; ability to regulate capital flows, there has been a general tendency    to greater capital account liberalization over time, including in emerging    markets. In theory, capital account liberalization can enhance long-term    growth prospects through allowing: (i) access to finance for investment at    lower cost; (ii) consumption-smoothing in the face of adverse shocks; (iii)    diversification of assets and liabilities across countries; (iv) &ldquo;technology    transfer&rdquo; from foreign banks; and (v) greater discipline on macroeconomic    policy. However, the empirical evidence is mixed, with some studies    suggesting considerable gains while others pointing to a weak or even    negative relationship between liberalization and growth. It also appears that    not all capital is equal: foreign direct investment is generally seen to be    beneficial while short-term debt is seen to carry greater risk. In view of    this, most commentators, including the IMF, have advocated a cautious and    sequenced liberalization framework embedded in a larger program of    macroeconomic and financial reforms. In the late 1990s, an effort was made to    enshrine capital account liberalization as part of members&rsquo; obligations, with    safeguards and transitional arrangements, under the IMF Articles of    Agreement. This effort was not successful, however, following the onset of    the Asian financial crisis. Nevertheless, agreements leading to greater    liberalization continue to be concluded through a variety of vehicles    including bilateral agreements (e.g., free trade and investment guarantee    agreements), regional treaties (e.g., the Treaty on the Functioning of the    European Union) and other agreements (e.g., the OECD Code of Liberalization    of Capital Movements).</td>

On    occasion, countries have temporarily imposed capital controls as a means of    creating policy space to enact countercyclical monetary policies and, in the    face of persistent and large inflows, mitigate the build up of risks. Recent    work by IMF staff suggest that these tools could have a role, especially in    the face of large and potentially destabilizing inflows, but that these need    to be anchored in an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework. The IMF    surveys countries to ascertain the measures in place that restrict capital    flows. The results are reported in the Fund&rsquo;s Annual Report on Exchange    Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER).

In recent discussions with regional financing arrangements    from Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, it was agreed that the    ultimate objective should be to strengthen surveillance and the effectiveness    of co-financing mechanisms for countries vulnerable to crises.

They also refer to savings/investment balances, where countries have an    excess of saving versus investment opportunities. The lack of an automatic    mechanism for dealing with global imbalances was seen as a key flaw in the    international monetary system, and thus became a key concern of the    international community, leading the IMF to convene multilateral    consultations to discuss the issue in 2006. The worry was these imbalances    were unsustainable and could lead to a disorderly adjustment caused by a    collapse in the value of the US dollar. In the global financial crisis, a    flight to safety led to a strengthening of the dollar. Nevertheless, many    remain concerned that allowed to persist, these imbalances would derail the    recovery by stymieing the needed adjustment in deficit countries. Some    commentators also point to the potential for the large capital flows    engendered by these imbalances to contribute to asset price bubbles and sow    the seeds for further instability.</td>

In practice, the system was not able to function as expected as    adherence to the standard often removed the prospect of allowing domestic monetary    policy to adjust to demand conditions. While proponents point to this as a    mechanism that forces discipline on governments and central banks, others    have noted a number of problems including that the supply of gold changes    slowly and often unpredictably leading to deflation in the long run, and    hoarding of specie by surplus countries that may cause disproportionate    contractions in other countries in the short term. Most commentators have    concluded that adherence to the gold standard was, at the very least, not    helpful in the face of the Great Depression in the early 20th Century, though    disagreements remain on how central the system was in causing and propagating    the downturn.</td>

It is a&nbsp;comprehensive approach&nbsp;to debt relief    which involves multilateral, Paris Club, and other official and bilateral    creditors.

A strong    track record of policy implementation is intended to ensure that debt relief    is put to effective use. Following a comprehensive review in 1999, the    Initiative was enhanced to provide faster, deeper, and broader debt relief    and to strengthen the links between debt relief, poverty reduction, and    social policies.

After the collapse    of the Bretton-Woods system, the present system has evolved in an ad hoc    fashion with the key currencies floating against one another, and currencies    of economies on the periphery largely managed in some manner against these    core currencies (often the U.S. dollar), leading some to dub the arrangements    a &ldquo;non-system&rdquo;. A key notion in this setup is that of reserve asset:    countries, even those with floating currencies, will need to have access to    foreign currency assets that can be used to intervene in markets during    periods of stress. This is even more so if a country fixes or manages its    exchange rate. Since the demise of real assets like gold as monetary anchors,    the U.S. dollar has been the world&rsquo;s principal reserve asset, with the euro    playing an important role. Other important reserve currencies include the    British pound and the Japanese yen.

The U.S. dollar-equivalent of the SDR, as well as its value against other    major currencies, is posted daily on the IMF&rsquo;s website. It is calculated as    the sum of specific amounts of the five basket currencies valued in U.S.    dollars, on the basis of exchange rates quoted at noon each day in the London    market. The basket composition is reviewed every five years by the Executive    Board to ensure that it reflects the relative importance of currencies in the    world's trading and financial systems.

It would involve having the IMF (or some other    supranational body) set up an account that would allow central banks to swap    dollar assets (typically, short-term U.S. T-bills) for SDRs (alternatively,    to boost the number of SDRs, central banks could swap reserves in exact    proportion to the components of the SDR basket). The account would in turn    convert the U.S. T-bills for longer-term claims on the U.S. Treasury, with    the spread between the long-term interest rate and the short-term rate paid    to SDR holders helping to cover the exchange rate risk. However, there was no    assurance that the exchange rate risk would be covered (e.g., the shift in    relative demand could flatten the yield curve and reduce the term premium).    Other mechanisms for sharing the exchange rate risk were floated, such as    investing in government bonds of the SDR component currencies or using a    portion of the IMF&rsquo;s gold stock to absorb the costs. All the proposals over    the years have not been acted on, in part because countries were never able    to settle on a mechanism for sharing exchange rate risk, but also because the    dollar&rsquo;s value recovered and a more sanguine view regarding its prospects    re-emerged.</td>

This process is known    as surveillance. The modalities of surveillance vary and include bilateral    consultations with members (also known as &ldquo;Article IV Consultations&rdquo;), the    production of global and regional reports such as the World Economic Outlook,    Global Financial Stability Report and the Fiscal Monitor, and exercises to    assess vulnerabilities in member countries (Early Warning Exercise,    vulnerability exercises for advanced and emerging economies). Other IMF    activities, such as the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) informs    surveillance. The IMF periodically reviews its experience with surveillance    through the Triennial Surveillance Review, last conducted in 2008. The next    Review will be completed in 2011. Based on the outcome of the Review, the    Executive Board will then set out the priorities that will guide Fund    surveillance over the medium term in a Statement of Surveillance Priorities.    Key priorities for IMF surveillance include better assessment of tail risks,    enhancing financial sector surveillance and real-financial linkages, improved    understanding of multilateral perspectives and more effective analysis of    risks to external stability.,A number of initiatives that would improve this    include better and more comprehensive treatment of spillovers in its reports,    and better oversight over the financial sector are the goals.</td>

At that time, because    global trade (and therefore demand for dollars to settle trade) was    increasing more quickly than growth in the US, any emissions of US debt would    necessarily be domestically inflationary and likely fiscally unsustainable.    On the other hand, if the US were to rein in spending and reduce both its    fiscal and external deficits, the world would lose its injections of needed    dollars and was in danger of slipping into a deflationary spiral. Coupled    with this, the US was also confronted with the expenditures related to the    war in Vietnam which saw it finally abandon the gold standard in 1971.</td>
